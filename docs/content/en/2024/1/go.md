{{< callout type="info" >}}
Basically, I'm not a fan of Go. It's more complicated than Python and slower than C++ and Rust. It certainly has its advantages over other languages. Unfortunately, they don't outweigh them for me. I only use the language because my friends use it (and the university department of databases)
